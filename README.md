MeiHMM: **M**is-segregation **E**rror **I**dentification through **H**idden **M**arkov **M**odels

MeiHMM segments trisomic chromosome 21 into blocks of two or three haplotype blocks and infers the stage of chromosome 21 nondisjunction in gametogenesis. It also identifies meiotic crossover event on chromosome 21. MeiHMM uses genotype data of Down syndrome proband, without requiring data from the parents.
